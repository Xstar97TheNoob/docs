I am excited to share that I have officially joined the TrueCharts project as a core team member. TrueCharts is a community-driven project that is focused on developing Helm charts and Scale apps for TrueNAS Scale, a popular operating system for network-attached storage. As a member of the core team, I will be working on the incubator train of the project.

The TrueCharts project is dedicated to creating high-quality, production-ready Helm charts and Scale apps that can be used by anyone.

The incubator train is a part of the TrueCharts project that is focused on developing and testing new Helm charts. These charts are not yet considered stable and are subject to change, but they are a great way to test out new applications and provide feedback to the community.

As a core team member, I will be working closely with other developers to build new Scale apps, test and improve existing ones, and provide support to the community. I am excited to be a part of this project because it is an opportunity to contribute to the open-source community, learn new skills, and work with a great group of people.

One of the things that I appreciate about the TrueCharts project is its focus on quality. The team is dedicated to creating high-quality, well-documented Helm charts that are easy to use. They also provide support through our Discord server, where users can ask questions and get help with any issues they may be having.

I am looking forward to continue working on the incubator train and contributing to the TrueCharts project. If you are interested in learning more about the project or want to get involved, I encourage you to check out our website and join our Discord server. It is a great way to get involved in the open-source community and contribute to a project that is making a real difference.
