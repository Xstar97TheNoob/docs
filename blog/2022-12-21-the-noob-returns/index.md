After a very long break from life and "adulting". I plan on creating content and streaming on various social media platforms again, I am excited to get back into the swing of things. It can be intimidating to start again after being gone for so long ðŸ¥º, but I am looking forward to reconnecting with my audience and sharing new content with them. I have missed the excitement of creating and sharing my content, and I am eager to get back into the groove of things. I am also looking forward to interacting with my community and hearing their thoughts and feedback on my content. Overall, I am thrilled to be returning to creating and streaming on social media, and I can't wait to see what the future holds.

I have decided to make a change in the type of content that I create and stream on social media. Previously, I focused just on gaming content, but I have over the year os so became interested in the field of IT and building a HomeLab. As a result, I will be shifting my focus to creating content related to IT and HomeLab building. While I am excited about this change and the new opportunities it presents, I also recognize that it may be a bit of a transition for my audience. I want to assure my community that I am still committed to providing high-quality content and engaging with them, even though the subject matter may be different. I am looking forward to exploring this new area and sharing my knowledge and experiences with my audience.
