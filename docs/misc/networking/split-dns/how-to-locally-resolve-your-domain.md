# How to Locally Resolve Your Domain

Split DNS or locally resolving the domain can offer several advantages, including:

- Improved network performance: Split DNS allows for local resolution of domain names, which can reduce the need for external DNS queries and improve network performance.

- Increased security: Split DNS can help prevent DNS-based attacks, such as cache poisoning or DNS spoofing, by keeping DNS queries local to the network and reducing exposure to external DNS servers.

- Better control over internal network resources: Locally resolving domain names can provide better control over internal network resources, such as servers or applications, by allowing for custom DNS records and routing rules.

- Reduced reliance on external DNS servers: Split DNS can reduce reliance on external DNS servers, which can improve network resilience and reduce the risk of service disruption caused by external factors such as DNS outages or network congestion.

Overall, split DNS or locally resolving domain names can offer several benefits for network administrators looking to improve network performance, security, and control over their internal resources.

## DNS server

The easiest way to implement split DNS is to set up a separate DNS server or servers on your local network that only respond to requests from within your network. These local DNS servers would be configured to handle DNS resolution for your internal network resources, such as servers or applications, while external DNS queries for public domain names would continue to be handled by your ISP or external DNS provider.

To implement split DNS, you will need to create two separate DNS zones: one for your internal network and one for external domains. The internal DNS zone would contain records for all internal resources, and the external DNS zone would contain records for public domain names.

You can configure your local DNS server to forward all external DNS queries to your ISP's DNS server or to a public DNS server such as Google DNS or OpenDNS. This will ensure that external domain names are still resolved correctly while keeping internal network traffic local to your network.

Overall, implementing split DNS requires some knowledge of DNS configuration and network infrastructure. However, it can provide significant benefits in terms of network performance, security, and control over internal resources.

## HostFile

The host file is another option for implementing split DNS, although it may not be as scalable or flexible as setting up a separate DNS server.

The host file is a simple text file that contains mappings of IP addresses to hostnames. By editing the host file on a local computer or server, you can override DNS resolution for specific domain names and point them to different IP addresses or hosts.

To use the host file for split DNS, you would need to manually add entries for all internal network resources to the host file on each client computer or server on your network. This can be time-consuming and difficult to maintain, especially if you have a large number of internal resources or if your network infrastructure changes frequently.

Additionally, using the host file may not be suitable for larger networks or environments with multiple subnets or VLANs. In these cases, a dedicated DNS server or servers may be a better option for managing DNS resolution and ensuring consistency across the network.

Overall, using the host file for split DNS can be a quick and simple solution for small networks or single machines, but it may not be the best option for larger or more complex environments.
