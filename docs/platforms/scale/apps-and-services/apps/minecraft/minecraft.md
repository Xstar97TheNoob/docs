### Exposing Your MineCraft Servers

The most straightforward approach is to forward your server's port if you only intend to play with a small group of friends. Nonetheless, this method can be insecure and might expose your network to various vulnerabilities.

MCRouter offers a fantastic solution by allowing you to forward a single port and make all your Minecraft servers accessible through that one port. This offers a significant advantage. While BungeeCord, Waterfall, and Velocity function similarly as proxy servers, they are limited in their support for specific server types, unlike MCRouter.
